# How to contribute?

1. Check how we handle tips in the files under `./tips/`
1. If you tip is something like **Remove Duplicates from array** name the file as `remove-duplicates-array.md`
1. Format should be as follow:
   ```
   ---
   title: "Title for your tip"
   language: "javascript"
   ---

   // Your tip code goes here
   ```
1. Open a PR with your tip, once we approve it will be available on the website
